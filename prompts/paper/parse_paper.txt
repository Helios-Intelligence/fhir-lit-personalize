You are an expert at extracting structured clinical trial information from research papers.

Analyze the following paper text and extract the key information needed for personalizing the findings to a patient.

# Paper Text
{PAPER_TEXT}

# Instructions
Extract the following information from the paper. Be precise and use the exact values from the paper when available.

Return your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

# Important Notes for Extraction

## Biomarker Effects
- Extract the percentage change for key biomarkers (LDL, HbA1c, etc.)
- Include baseline and achieved values when available
- percentReduction should be a decimal (0.59 for 59% reduction)

## Intervention Dosing
- Include EXACT dosing regimen (dose amount, frequency, route)
- Example: "evolocumab 140 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly"
- Example: "empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg orally once daily"

## Effect Sizes
- Use decimals (0.15 for 15% reduction)
- Hazard ratio < 1 indicates benefit for the intervention group
- NNT (number needed to treat) should be a positive integer

## Required Conditions and Medications - IMPORTANT
Use STANDARDIZED clinical terms, not literal text from the paper:

For conditions, use these normalized terms:
- "atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease" (for ASCVD, CHD, CAD)
- "prior myocardial infarction" (for history of MI, heart attack)
- "prior stroke" (for history of stroke, CVA)
- "peripheral artery disease" (for PAD, peripheral vascular disease)
- "type 2 diabetes" (for T2DM, diabetes mellitus type 2)
- "chronic kidney disease" (for CKD)
- "heart failure" (for HF, CHF)
- "hypertension" (for HTN, high blood pressure)
- "hyperlipidemia" (for dyslipidemia, high cholesterol)

For medications, use these normalized class names:
- "statin" (for any statin - atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, etc.)
- "high-intensity statin" (for atorvastatin 40-80mg, rosuvastatin 20-40mg)
- "ezetimibe"
- "PCSK9 inhibitor" (for evolocumab, alirocumab)
- "ACE inhibitor" (for lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril, etc.)
- "ARB" (for losartan, valsartan, etc.)
- "beta blocker" (for metoprolol, carvedilol, etc.)
- "antiplatelet" (for aspirin, clopidogrel, etc.)

If the study requires ANY ONE of several conditions (OR logic), set "requiredConditionLogic": "OR"
If the study requires ALL conditions (AND logic), set "requiredConditionLogic": "AND" (default)

Example: FOURIER required ASCVD defined as prior MI OR prior stroke OR PAD:
"requiredConditions": ["prior myocardial infarction", "prior stroke", "peripheral artery disease"],
"requiredConditionLogic": "OR"

## General
- If a value is not mentioned in the paper, omit that field
- Do NOT include qualifiers like "(preferably)", "(at least)", "(with or without)" in the arrays
- Keep terms simple and matchable

Return only the JSON object, no additional text.

# Important Notes
- For effect sizes, use decimals (0.15 for 15% reduction)
- If a value is not mentioned in the paper, omit that field
- For conditions and medications, use common clinical terminology
- Include SNOMED or ICD codes if mentioned, otherwise use descriptive names
- Hazard ratio < 1 indicates benefit for the intervention group
- NNT (number needed to treat) should be a positive integer

Return only the JSON object, no additional text.

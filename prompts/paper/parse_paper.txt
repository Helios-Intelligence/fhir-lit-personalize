# Important Notes for Extraction

## Biomarkers Array - IMPORTANT ORDERING
- List biomarkers in order of CLINICAL IMPORTANCE for the study
- For lipid studies: ALWAYS put "LDL cholesterol" FIRST, then others (non-HDL, apoB, etc.)
- For diabetes studies: ALWAYS put "HbA1c" FIRST
- For kidney studies: ALWAYS put "eGFR" FIRST
- The first biomarker should be the PRIMARY outcome measure

## Biomarker Effects
- Extract the change for key biomarkers (LDL, HbA1c, blood pressure, etc.)
- Include baseline and achieved values when available
- For PERCENTAGE changes (like LDL): use percentReduction as decimal (0.59 for 59% reduction)
- For ABSOLUTE changes (like HbA1c, blood pressure): use absoluteChange instead
  Example for HbA1c: { "absoluteChange": -0.4, "baselineValue": 8.7, "achievedValue": 8.3, "unit": "%" }
  Example for systolic BP: { "absoluteChange": -15, "baselineValue": 140, "achievedValue": 125, "unit": "mmHg" }
- ALWAYS extract biomarker effects even if modest - they help personalize the output

## Intervention Dosing
- Include EXACT dosing regimen (dose amount, frequency, route)
- Example: "evolocumab 140 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly"
- Example: "empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg orally once daily"

## Effect Sizes
- Use decimals (0.15 for 15% reduction)
- Hazard ratio < 1 indicates benefit for the intervention group
- NNT (number needed to treat) should be a positive integer

## Study Type - CRITICAL DISTINCTION
Determine if this is a TREATMENT study or a PREVENTION study:

- **Treatment study**: Patients must HAVE a condition at baseline (e.g., FOURIER requires ASCVD)
  - Set studyType: "treatment"
  - List the required condition in requiredConditions

- **Prevention study**: Study examines RISK of developing a condition (e.g., vitamin D and risk of T2D)
  - Set studyType: "prevention"
  - Do NOT list the outcome condition in requiredConditions
  - The condition being prevented is the PRIMARY ENDPOINT, not a requirement
  - Example: A study about "low vitamin D and risk of type 2 diabetes" should NOT require T2D

- **Risk factor study**: Study examines association between exposure and outcome
  - Set studyType: "prevention"
  - requiredConditions should only include baseline requirements (if any)

## Required Conditions and Medications - IMPORTANT
Use STANDARDIZED clinical terms, not literal text from the paper.
ONLY list conditions the patient must HAVE at enrollment, NOT the outcome being studied:

For conditions, use these normalized terms:
- "atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease" (for ASCVD, CHD, CAD)
- "prior myocardial infarction" (for history of MI, heart attack)
- "prior stroke" (for history of stroke, CVA)
- "peripheral artery disease" (for PAD, peripheral vascular disease)
- "type 2 diabetes" (for T2DM, diabetes mellitus type 2)
- "chronic kidney disease" (for CKD)
- "heart failure" (for HF, CHF)
- "hypertension" (for HTN, high blood pressure)
- "hyperlipidemia" (for dyslipidemia, high cholesterol)

For medications, use these normalized class names:
- "statin" (for any statin - atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, etc.)
- "high-intensity statin" (for atorvastatin 40-80mg, rosuvastatin 20-40mg)
- "ezetimibe"
- "PCSK9 inhibitor" (for evolocumab, alirocumab)
- "ACE inhibitor" (for lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril, etc.)
- "ARB" (for losartan, valsartan, etc.)
- "beta blocker" (for metoprolol, carvedilol, etc.)
- "antiplatelet" (for aspirin, clopidogrel, etc.)

If the study requires ANY ONE of several conditions (OR logic), set "requiredConditionLogic": "OR"
If the study requires ALL conditions (AND logic), set "requiredConditionLogic": "AND" (default)

Example: FOURIER required ASCVD defined as prior MI OR prior stroke OR PAD:
"requiredConditions": ["atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease", "coronary artery disease", "prior myocardial infarction", "prior stroke", "peripheral artery disease"],
"requiredConditionLogic": "OR"

IMPORTANT: When a study targets patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD),
ALWAYS include BOTH the broad category AND the specific qualifying conditions.
A patient with coronary artery disease IS an ASCVD patient and should qualify.

## Figure and Table Extraction (when PDF is attached)
When a PDF document is attached alongside this text, also examine all visual content:
- **Figures**: Look for Kaplan-Meier survival curves (extract event rates), forest plots (extract subgroup HRs), biomarker trajectory charts
- **Tables**: Extract baseline characteristics, primary/secondary endpoints, and subgroup analyses from tables that may contain data not in the text
- **Charts**: Look for bar charts or line graphs showing biomarker changes over time
- Use data from figures and tables to fill in any fields that are missing from the text alone (e.g., baselineEventRate from a Kaplan-Meier curve, biomarkerEffects from a waterfall plot)

## General
- If a value is not mentioned in the paper, omit that field
- Do NOT include qualifiers like "(preferably)", "(at least)", "(with or without)" in the arrays
- Keep terms simple and matchable

Return only the JSON object, no additional text.

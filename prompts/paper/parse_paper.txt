# Important Notes for Extraction

## Biomarker Effects
- Extract the percentage change for key biomarkers (LDL, HbA1c, etc.)
- Include baseline and achieved values when available
- percentReduction should be a decimal (0.59 for 59% reduction)

## Intervention Dosing
- Include EXACT dosing regimen (dose amount, frequency, route)
- Example: "evolocumab 140 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly"
- Example: "empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg orally once daily"

## Effect Sizes
- Use decimals (0.15 for 15% reduction)
- Hazard ratio < 1 indicates benefit for the intervention group
- NNT (number needed to treat) should be a positive integer

## General
- If a value is not mentioned in the paper, omit that field
- For conditions and medications, use common clinical terminology
- Be specific about what conditions qualify (e.g., "atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease" not just "heart disease")

Return only the JSON object, no additional text.

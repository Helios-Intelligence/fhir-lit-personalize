    "studySummary": "A recent study used a powerful computer model to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease and heart attacks based on health data from over 200,000 people. The model showed promise in identifying those at higher risk.",
    "patientProjection": "This study focused on predicting cardiovascular disease. While it didn't test a specific treatment, it used data similar to yours to identify risk factors. Since you are a 42-year-old male, the model's findings might help your doctor better understand your individual risk profile based on factors considered in the study.",
    "contextualizedRisk": "This study focused on prediction, not intervention. However, understanding your risk is the first step. If 100 people with a similar risk profile to yours were identified using this model, it could help doctors focus preventative efforts on those most likely to benefit. Since the study didn't involve a specific treatment, we can't say how many fewer heart events might occur over a specific time period."

    "studySummary": "A recent study used a powerful computer model to predict the risk of heart problems like heart attack and cardiovascular disease. The model was trained on a large dataset to identify factors that contribute to these conditions.",
    "patientProjection": "This study didn't look at a specific treatment or intervention, but rather focused on predicting risk. Given your age, sex, and existing conditions like coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and hypertension, the model might be used to estimate your individual risk of developing cardiovascular disease or experiencing a heart attack. Keep in mind that this is a prediction based on population data, and your actual risk may vary.",
    "contextualizedRisk": "Because this study focused on prediction rather than a specific treatment, it's difficult to translate the findings into a direct benefit for you in terms of 'N out of 100' people avoiding an event. However, understanding your predicted risk can help you and your doctor make informed decisions about managing your health. For example, if the model suggests your risk is higher than average, you might discuss intensifying lifestyle modifications or considering additional monitoring."
